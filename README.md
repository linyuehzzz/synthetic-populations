# Generating Small Area Synthetic Microdata for Public Use: Towards Accessible and Reproducible Spatial Data Science

This is an implementation of our small area synthetic microdata (SASM) generator on Python3. We formulate an optimization problem to generate SASM by minimizing the difference between published census tables and the SASM. This method only requires a set of census tables that are publicly available in most countries as input to provide effective results.
